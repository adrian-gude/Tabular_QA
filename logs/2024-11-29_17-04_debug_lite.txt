 Here's the Python code that addresses the given query:

```python
import pandas as pd

def answer(df: pd.DataFrame) -> bool:
    df['author_name_length'] = df['author_name'].str.len()
    original_content = df[df['type'] == 'original'].index
    longest_author = df[df['author_name_length'] == df['author_name_length'].max()].index[0]

    return longest_author in original_content
```

In this code, we first create a new column `author_name_length` to store the length of each author's name. Then, we filter the dataframe to only include rows with the 'type' of 'original'. After that, we find the index of the author with the longest name and compare it to the indices of the original content. If the author with the longest name is in the original content, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

    night_time = pd.Series(index=df.index, data=[time(22) for _ in df.index])
    return (df['date_time'] < night_time).any()
```

In this code, we first convert the 'date_time' column to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`. Then, we create a series of night time (22:00) for each row in the dataset. Finally, we check if any transaction occurred before the night time by using the `<` operator and the `any()` function, which returns a boolean value indicating whether any element in the resulting series is `True`.
Response: __CODE_ERROR__: time data "13-11-2016 14:14" doesn't match format "%m-%d-%Y %H:%M", at position 1. You might want to try:

    return df[(df['time'] >= 18) & (df['is_weekend'] == 1)].empty
```

In this code, we first extract the hour from the 'date_time' column and create a new column 'time'. Then, we create a binary column 'is_weekend' to indicate whether the transaction occurred on a weekend or not. Finally, we filter the DataFrame to only include transactions that happened in the evening (18:00 or later) and on weekends, and check if the resulting DataFrame is empty. If it is, there are no transactions recorded in the evening on weekends.

    grouped = df.groupby('Item')['period_day'].value_counts()
    most_frequent_period = grouped.index[grouped.argmax()]
    return most_frequent_period
```

This code assumes that the dataset is already preprocessed and the 'Item' column contains the product names. The function groups the data by item and counts the number of occurrences for each period_day. It then finds the index of the most frequent period for the item "Brownie" and returns that index as the answer.

    df = df[df['transaction']!= 0]
    df = df.sort_values('transaction').head(2)
    return df[['Transaction', 'date_time']].to_dict('records')[0]['Transaction']
```

This code first creates a new column 'time' to store the hour of the 'date_time' column. Then it filters the dataframe for morning hours (6am to 10am). After that, it filters out the rows where the transaction is zero. Finally, it sorts the dataframe by transaction in descending order and returns the lowest 2 transaction numbers where purchases were made in the morning. The output is a dictionary containing the 'Transaction' and 'date_time' columns for the two lowest transaction numbers.

    result.sort()
    if len(result) > 3:
        result = result[:3]
    return result
```

This code first selects the 'legs' and 'animal_name' columns from the given DataFrame. Then, it finds the top 3 animals with the most legs using the `value_counts().head(3)` method. After that, it creates a list of animal names that correspond to the top 3 leg counts. If there are more than three animals with the same number of legs, it sorts the list alphabetically and returns the top 3.

    least_animals_classes = [c for c in least_common_classes if len(df[df['class_type'] == c]) == min(least_common_classes.map(len))]
    return least_animals_classes
```

This code first counts the number of occurrences of each class type using the `value_counts()` method. Then, it finds the three least common class types and stores them in the `least_common_classes` list. After that, it filters the least common classes to only include those with the least number of animals. Finally, it returns the least common classes with the least animals as a list.

    df['total_legs'] += df['legs'].str.extract('(\d+)', expand=True).astype(int)
    result = df.groupby('class_type')['total_legs'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(4)
    return result.index[-4:]
```

This code first calculates the total number of legs for each row by replacing non-digit characters with an empty string, counting the number of characters, and then adding the number extracted from the string using regex. After that, it groups the dataframe by class type, calculates the total number of legs for each class type, sorts them in descending order, and returns the indices of the bottom 4 class types.
Response: __CODE_ERROR__: Can only use .str accessor with string values!
--------------------
 Here's the Python code to find the most common 4 numbers of legs that animals have in the given dataset:

    legs = df['legs'].values
    unique_legs = set(legs)
    counts = {leg: len(legs) for leg in unique_legs if len(leg) in [4]}
    sorted_counts = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    most_common_4_legs = [leg for leg, count in sorted_counts[:4]]
    return most_common_4_legs
```

This code first extracts the 'legs' column from the DataFrame, converts it to a list of numbers, and then finds the unique numbers of legs present in the dataset. It then creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique numbers of legs and the values are the counts of those numbers of legs. The dictionary is filtered to only include the numbers of legs that are 4. The sorted dictionary is then sliced to get the most common 4 numbers of legs. Finally, the function returns a list containing the most common 4 numbers of legs.
Response: __CODE_ERROR__: object of type 'numpy.int64' has no len()

    least_common_3 = legs.head(3)[-3:].index.tolist()
    return least_common_3
```

This code first counts the number of occurrences of each leg value in the dataset using the `value_counts()` method. Then, it selects the least common 3 numbers of legs by using the `head()` method with the `-3` argument to get the last 3 rows and the `[-3:]` slice to select those rows. Finally, it returns the indices of the least common 3 numbers of legs as a list.

    unique_customers = df['CustomerID'].unique()
    missing_customers = set(range(1, len(df) + 1)) - unique_customers
    return bool(missing_customers)
```

This code uses the `unique()` method to find all unique customer IDs in the dataset. Then, it creates a set containing numbers from 1 to the total number of rows in the dataset. By subtracting the unique customer IDs from the set of all possible customer IDs, it identifies any missing customer IDs. Finally, it returns a boolean value indicating whether any missing customer IDs were found.
